# MediCare FHIR API Testing Report

## Summary

This report documents the testing of the MediCare FHIR API endpoints, issues identified, and fixes implemented. The testing focused on ensuring that all API endpoints are working correctly, with proper URL rewriting and parameter handling.

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. URL Rewriting

**Issue:** The API was not correctly rewriting URLs from the internal HAPI FHIR server to the external API URL in responses.

**Fix:** 
- Added the `APP_EXTERNAL_URL` environment variable to the Docker Compose file.
- Enhanced logging in the `HapiFhirAdapter` class to debug URL rewriting issues.
- Fixed URL rewriting logic to properly handle all links in FHIR Bundle responses.

### 2. Resource Not Found Errors

**Issue:** Some resources with numeric IDs (e.g., `Observation/1`, `Encounter/1`) were not found because the HAPI FHIR server doesn't allow client-assigned IDs that are purely numeric.

**Fix:**
- Created resources with alphanumeric IDs (e.g., `obs-1`, `enc-1`) as the HAPI FHIR server requires at least one non-numeric character in client-assigned IDs.
- Implemented an `IdFormatMiddleware` that automatically converts purely numeric IDs to alphanumeric format (prefixing with `res-`) in both the request URL and body.
- Updated API documentation to inform users about the ID format requirements.

### 3. Value Range Search Parameters

**Issue:** The `value-min` and `value-max` search parameters for Observation resources were not supported by the HAPI FHIR server.

**Fix:**
- Added custom search parameters to the HAPI FHIR server.
- Updated the `transformObservationParameters` method in the `HapiFhirAdapter` class to transform `value-min` and `value-max` parameters to the FHIR-compliant `value-quantity` parameter with appropriate prefixes.

### 4. Pagination with Page Parameter

**Issue:** The `page` parameter was not correctly handled for pagination.

**Fix:**
- Improved the `transformSearchParameters` method in the `HapiFhirAdapter` class to correctly handle the `page` parameter and convert it to the HAPI FHIR `_getpagesoffset` parameter.
- Ensured that the `_count` parameter is always set when using pagination.

### ID Format Middleware Testing

| Test | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Create resource with numeric ID | ✅ Pass | Automatically converts to alphanumeric format |
| Retrieve resource with numeric ID | ✅ Pass | Transparently converts ID and retrieves resource |
| Retrieve resource with alphanumeric ID | ✅ Pass | Works as expected |

## Recommendations

1. **ID Handling**: The system now automatically converts purely numeric IDs to alphanumeric format. However, it's still recommended to use alphanumeric IDs in client applications for consistency.

2. **Custom Search Parameters**: For any custom search parameters not natively supported by the HAPI FHIR server, register them as SearchParameter resources before using them.

3. **Pagination**: Use the `_count` parameter along with the `page` parameter for consistent pagination results.

4. **URL Configuration**: Ensure the `APP_EXTERNAL_URL` environment variable is correctly set in the Docker Compose file to enable proper URL rewriting.

## Conclusion

The MediCare FHIR API is now functioning correctly for all endpoints and use cases. The URL rewriting issue has been resolved successfully, and the API is correctly proxying requests to the HAPI FHIR server while transforming the URLs in the responses. The ID format middleware provides a transparent solution to the HAPI FHIR server's requirement for alphanumeric IDs, allowing clients to use numeric IDs without any issues.

## Next Steps

1. Monitor the API for any performance issues related to URL rewriting on large response payloads.
2. Consider adding more comprehensive tests for edge cases.
3. Document the ID format middleware in the API documentation for developers who might need to bypass it in specific cases.
