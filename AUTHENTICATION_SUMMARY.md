# MediCare FHIR API Authentication System

## Current Status

The authentication system is now fully functional. All user accounts can successfully log in, and the password hashing issue has been resolved.

## Issues Identified and Fixed

1. **Double Password Hashing**
   - **Issue**: Passwords were being hashed twice - once in `UsersService.create()` and again in the Mongoose pre-save hook.
   - **Fix**: Removed the direct password hashing in `UsersService.create()` and let the pre-save hook handle it.

2. **User Registration Process**
   - The system requires an access code for registration, which links users to their FHIR resources.
   - First-time registration without an access code is only allowed for the first admin user.

## Authentication Flow

1. **Registration**
   - User receives an access code (via email or admin)
   - User registers with email, password, and access code
   - System verifies the access code and links the user to their FHIR resource
   - User account is created and activated

2. **Login**
   - User provides email and password
   - System verifies credentials and returns an access token
   - Token contains user ID, email, and role information

3. **Authorization**
   - User includes the access token in API requests
   - System verifies the token and checks user permissions
   - Access is granted based on user role and resource ownership

## Test Accounts

The following test accounts are available for testing:

### Admin User
```
Email: admin@test.com
Password: Admin123
```

### Patient User
```
Email: patient@med.com
Password: Patient123!
```

### Practitioner User
```
Email: doctor@med.com
Password: Doctor123!
```

## API Endpoints

### Authentication

- `POST /api/auth/login` - Login with email and password
- `POST /api/auth/register` - Register a new user with access code
- `POST /api/auth/verify-access-code` - Verify an access code
- `POST /api/auth/request-password-reset` - Request a password reset code
- `POST /api/auth/reset-password` - Reset password with code

### User Management

- `GET /api/users/profile` - Get current user profile
- `PUT /api/users/profile` - Update current user profile
- `GET /api/users` - List all users (admin only)
- `POST /api/users` - Create a new user (admin only)
- `GET /api/users/:id` - Get user by ID (admin only)
- `PUT /api/users/:id` - Update user by ID (admin only)
- `DELETE /api/users/:id` - Delete user by ID (admin only)

## Next Steps

1. **Implement Email Verification**
   - Add email verification during registration
   - Update user status after email verification

2. **Enhance Password Security**
   - Add password complexity requirements
   - Implement account lockout after failed login attempts

3. **Implement Two-Factor Authentication**
   - Add optional 2FA for enhanced security
   - Support app-based or SMS-based verification codes

4. **Audit Logging**
   - Log authentication events
   - Track login attempts and password changes

## Testing

A test script is available to verify the authentication functionality:

```
node test-password-fix.js
```

This script tests login for all test accounts and attempts to register a new user.
