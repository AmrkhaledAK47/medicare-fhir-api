# Refactored Authentication Flow for MediCare FHIR API

This document outlines the changes made to the authentication flow for the MediCare FHIR API, focusing on how users are registered, authenticated, and authorized to access FHIR resources.

## Changes Made

### 1. Streamlined Resource Creation with Access Codes

- **Before**: Admin would create users through `/api/users` endpoints, then separately create FHIR resources and manually link them.
- **After**: Admin creates FHIR resources directly through `/api/fhir/:resourceType/with-access-code` endpoints, which automatically generate access codes and send emails.

### 2. Enhanced Access Code System

- **Before**: Access codes were not consistently linked to FHIR resources.
- **After**: Access codes now store the FHIR resource type and ID, ensuring proper linking during registration.

### 3. Improved Email Notifications

- **Before**: Emails contained generic information about access codes.
- **After**: Emails now include specific information about the FHIR resource created for the user.

### 4. Consolidated Registration Process

- **Before**: Multiple steps were needed to complete registration.
- **After**: Single registration endpoint that verifies the access code, creates the user account, and links it to the FHIR resource.

### 5. Removed Redundant Endpoints

- Removed the specialized `/api/users/patients/with-access-code` endpoint in favor of the more generic `/api/fhir/:resourceType/with-access-code` pattern.

## Implementation Details

### Updated Files

1. **src/fhir/fhir.controller.ts**
   - Enhanced the `createResourceWithAccessCode` endpoint with better documentation and validation.

2. **src/auth/auth.service.ts**
   - Updated the `register` method to properly verify access codes and link users to FHIR resources.

3. **src/access-codes/schemas/access-code.schema.ts**
   - Added `recipientEmail` field to store the email address the access code was sent to.

4. **src/access-codes/access-codes.service.ts**
   - Enhanced the `create` and `sendAccessCodeEmail` methods to include FHIR resource information.

5. **AUTH_FLOW_DOCUMENTATION.md**
   - Created comprehensive documentation of the new authentication flow.

6. **test_auth_flow.sh**
   - Created a test script to verify the new authentication flow.

## New Authentication Flow

1. **Admin creates FHIR resource with access code**:
   ```
   POST /api/fhir/Patient/with-access-code?email=patient@example.com
   ```

2. **User receives email with access code**:
   The email contains the access code and information about the FHIR resource.

3. **User registers with access code**:
   ```
   POST /api/auth/register
   {
     "name": "John Doe",
     "email": "patient@example.com",
     "password": "securepassword",
     "accessCode": "ABC123"
   }
   ```

4. **User logs in and accesses resources**:
   ```
   POST /api/auth/login
   GET /api/fhir/Patient/{id}
   ```

## Benefits of the New Flow

1. **Simplified Administration**: Admins can create resources and generate access codes in a single step.
2. **Improved User Experience**: Users receive clear information about their account and resources.
3. **Enhanced Security**: Access codes are properly linked to resources and emails, preventing misuse.
4. **Better Architecture**: The system follows RESTful principles with a more logical endpoint structure.
5. **Reduced Complexity**: Fewer steps and endpoints to manage and maintain.

## Testing the New Flow

The `test_auth_flow.sh` script demonstrates the complete flow from admin login to patient/practitioner registration and resource access. Run it to verify that the authentication system is working correctly:

```bash
./test_auth_flow.sh
```

## Next Steps

1. **Implement Token Refresh**: Add the ability to refresh JWT tokens without requiring users to log in again.
2. **Enhanced Logging**: Add more detailed logging of authentication and authorization events.
3. **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting for authentication endpoints to prevent brute force attacks.
