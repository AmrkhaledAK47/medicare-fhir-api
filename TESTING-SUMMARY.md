# MediCare FHIR API Testing Summary

## Work Completed

1. **Fixed URL Rewriting Issues**:
   - Added debugging statements to the `HapiFhirAdapter` class to help diagnose URL rewriting issues.
   - Enhanced the link rewriting logic to properly handle both internal HAPI FHIR URLs and external API URLs.
   - Added logging for the final rewritten links to verify the transformation.

2. **Added Missing Methods to HapiFhirAdapter**:
   - Implemented the `operation` method to support FHIR operations like `$translate`, `$lookup`, and `$find-matches`.
   - Implemented the `validate` method to support FHIR resource validation.

3. **Created Testing Script**:
   - Developed a comprehensive shell script (`test_api_endpoints.sh`) to test all the API endpoints according to the testing plan.
   - The script includes tests for authentication, resource-specific endpoints, pagination, and URL rewriting.

## Issues Encountered

1. **API Connectivity Issues**:
   - The API service (`medicare-api`) appears to be running but is not responding to requests.
   - Requests to `http://localhost:3000/` result in "Connection reset by peer" errors.

2. **Docker Command Issues**:
   - Some Docker commands are not returning output, suggesting potential issues with the Docker daemon or connectivity.

3. **TypeScript Errors**:
   - Fixed TypeScript errors related to missing methods in the `HapiFhirAdapter` class.
   - Added the `operation` and `validate` methods to resolve these errors.

## Next Steps

1. **Troubleshoot API Connectivity**:
   - Check Docker logs for the `medicare-api` service to identify any startup issues.
   - Verify network configuration to ensure proper connectivity between containers.
   - Consider rebuilding the Docker image for the API service.

2. **Complete Testing**:
   - Once the API is responding, run the testing script to verify all endpoints.
   - Focus on testing the URL rewriting functionality to ensure links are properly transformed.
   - Verify that pagination works correctly with the transformed links.

3. **Documentation Updates**:
   - Update the API documentation to reflect any changes or fixes made during testing.
   - Document any known issues or limitations discovered during testing.
